<div id="intro">
	<p>One can not measure life on the axis of time alone, but rather on those of experience, strife and resilience. In spite of my mere quarter of a century on Earth so far, I've had the good fortune to amass quite a range of successes, and even more importantly, a healthy dose of failures.</p>
	<p>From my high school band getting kicked off the stage by the next artist to perform, who later came to be known as Lady Gaga, to writing half of a novel while aboard a cargo ship for a month crossing the Pacific Ocean, to overseeing billions of dollars in daily trading for the largest hedge fund in the world, to narrowly escaping bleeding to death in a roadside ditch in the remote mountains of northern Laos, my story so far runs the gambit. From every experience, good or bad, I've taken something away about myself and the world I inhabit.</p>
	<p>What follows are thoughts and life lessons I've cultivated along the way. My opinions are based on reasoning, experience and knowledge, not on how they might be recieved, and I reserve all rights to the wholesome practice of changing my mind. The path to wisdom often takes one by many a painful truth, but if I've learned anything in my life, it's that ignorance is the one thing that hurts worse.</p>

	<h2>Travels</h2>
	<p>In the spring of 2015 I left New York City with one goal: travel about the circumference of the earth using any means but flight to move me closer to my destination of returning to NYC (from the opposite direction I had left in). The plan: roadtrip across the United States, spend a month in a cargo ship crossing the Pacific Ocean, buy a motorcycle in Ho Chi Minh City to journey through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, then backtrack for a railway journey across China and along the Trans-Siberian Railroad through Russia, followed by a grand tour of Scandanavia, the Baltic, Turkey, Europe and the UK, before finally finding passage by sea across the Atlantic back "home."

	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<p>Ongoing projects I am involved in at various stages of development.</p>

	<div class="row1 clearfix">
		<div class="project">
			<h3>Therefore I Vote</h3>
			<p>A non-partisan campaign for independent thought committed to improving the level of engagement in the political system. Unlike typical voter activism campaigns, Therefore I Vote emphasizes positive reinforcement, accessible 'how-to' informational media and fostering engaging thought provoking discussion, rather than a numbers only focus on pressuring or shaming as many people as possible into registering to vote.</p>

			<h3>Paradigm Management</h3>
			<p>The modern manager's guide to empowering your employees in order to get the most out of them and yourself! How to ensure problems are perceived and solved faster and help employees work more directly towards achieving larger departmental goals. It's time to embrace the organizational efficiences created when strict, vertical hierarchies are replaced by employee autonomy, peer accountability and self automation.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h3>Hazardous Immaterials</h3>
			<p>An upcoming science-fiction novel exploring the human identity as an individual, as a society and as an increasingly obsolete carbon-based life form, and the ramifications for the major mechanisms of human interaction: personal, political and economic. Even the smallest factors we tend to ignore about ourselves as individuals and as a society compound to have wide reaching effects...</p>

	<h2>About</h2>
	<p>Matt O'Connor is a semi-autonomous quasi-rational seemingly self-aware biological mechanism which processes raw materials into concepts, ideas and dreams that he hopes will have tangible impacts on the world. Because he's fairly certain there exists a tangible world to be conceptually impacted. A time traveler from the late 1980's, he is now a writer, entrepreneur and thinker.</p>
	<p>After graduating from Emory University with a degree in business he worked in finance for several years before leaving behind career, car, home and heartthrob for a multi-year trip to travel around the entire circumference of the globe by any means but flying.</p>
	<p>Originally from NYC, the next major stop of his pseudo-nomadic lifestyle is Hong Kong. His main interests are philosophy, politics, science fiction, technology and just about any band or musical genre to prominently feature synthesizers.</p>
