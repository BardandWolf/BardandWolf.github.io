		<h3>What are runes and the Elder Futhark?</h3>
		<p> Runes are the symbols which compose runic alphabets, the written form of various Germanic and Scandanavian languages. Though different styles and variations of runic alphabets arose, generally their shapes prominently feature straight lines and sharp angles, far easier and simpler than curves or rounded edges for skalds of the time to engrave on wood, stone or metal.</p>
		<p>The Elder Futhark, as its name implies, is the oldest known runic alphabet. It is composed of 24 symbols which each correspond to a spoken sound of Proto-Norse, the Germanic based language which predates modern Scandavain languages. As the spoken word evolved, so did the runes, with the Elder Futhark eventually evolving into the 16 character Younger Futhark, both of which take their name from the sounds of their first six letters (f-u-th-a-r-k). Despite the evolution of runic alphabets, the Elder Futhark remains the original form of runes which were used to transcribe and are frequently referenced in many of the old Norse sagas and myths.</p>
		<p>In fact the Elder Futhark's very origin is imbibed with a mythical nature, the sagas attest the runes were first discovered by the Norse god Odin through a process of great personal sacrifice, demonstrating the great cost and value of wisdom. Odin, and practioners to follow him, mythic and mortal alike, used the runes not only for communication, but also for charms, spells and divination.</p>
		<p>Much the same way a fine painting can be understood across many aspects, from the techniques employed to the symbolic content of the painting to its historical importance, the runes can be understood on multiple dimensions. In addition to corresponding to a spoken sound, each rune also represents a specific concept or entity, ranging from symbols invoking fortune or protection to hunger or sacrifice.</p>

				<li>Game Design</li>
					<p>
					Rune Tree is a competitive multiplayer game in which players must rely on strategy, luck and negotiation to win. The game represents the search for wisdom, an integral theme to the runes, as players complete cascading sections of the Elder Futhark, and in doing so gain the mastery required to invoke special abilities corresponding to runes in each section.
					<br>
					<br>
					The game divides the 24 runes of the Elder Futhark along their conceptual or mythical representations into three sets of 8 (known as aetts), those that represent universal forces, those that represental external forces and worldy elements, and those that represent self learning and internal forces. Each rune's special ability relates to its unique meaning within the context of its set, so while each of the 24 runes has a different effect when invoked, runes in the universal set affect elements of the board or game itself, runes in the external forces set influence your fellow players, and runes in the internal set affect yourself directly.
