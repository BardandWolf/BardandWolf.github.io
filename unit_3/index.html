		<p>One can not measure insight or wisdom on the axis of time alone, but rather on those of experience, strife and resilience. In spite of my mere quarter of a century on Earth so far, I've had the good fortune to amass quite a range of experiences, with successes and failures alike.</p>
		<p>From my high school band getting kicked off the stage by the next artist to perform, who later came to be known as Lady Gaga, to writing half of a novel in a month while aboard a cargo ship crossing the Pacific Ocean, to overseeing billions of dollars of trades each day for the largest hedge fund in the world, to narrowly escaping bleeding to death in a roadside ditch in the remote mountains of northern Laos, time and time again I have been humbled and risen from my own ashes, each time taking something away with me about myself and the world I inhabit.</p>
		<p>What follows are some of the thoughts, insights and life lessons I've gained along the way. My opinions are based on reasoning, theory, experience and knowledge, not how they might be recieved, and I reserve the right to change my mind given new revelations. Whether you find me refreshingly candid and illuminating, or brazen and idiotic, you will always find me unapologetically sincere. The path to wisdom often takes one by many a painful truth, but if I've learned anything in my life, its that ignorance is the one thing that hurts worse.</p>

	<p class="quote">"The proper function of man is to live, not to exist." <br> - Jack London</p>
	<h2>Why Does Truth Matter?</h2>
	<p>While the universal question, 'why are we here?', will likely forever remain unanswered, at least in any scientifically provable manner, I purport that true happiness is more than just the next best thing in leiu of an answer, it is the complete fulfillment of one's existence. A deep, comphrehensive happiness, unlike cheap, temporary thrills and pleasures, is a complex, multifarious creature which involves several dimensions of human experience and identity. I identify six distinct elements of life, all of which one must satisfy, for one to be truly happy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Self Acceptance</li>
		<li>Social Engagement</li>
		<li>Physical/Material Security</li>
		<li>Metaphysical Exploration</li>
		<li>Sense of Purpose</li>
		<li>Creative Expression</li>
	</ul>

	<p>I see knowledge as critical to happiness in each of these elements, perhaps self acceptance and physical or material security being the areas where this is most immediately apparent. Knowledge and truth are not mere nice things to have, painful things to avoid, or unecessary byproducts, but the foundations with which we can begin to pursue happiness in each of these dimensions. Through an examination of thoughts, experiences and insights pertaining to one or more of these six areas, we gain futher understanding in those relevant areas, and I thus see a step towards a successful pursuit of knowledge, which both parallels and enables a successful pursuit of happiness, and in turn, a successful life itself.</p>
